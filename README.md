| 1 | Saiki Kusuo no Î¨-nan | Saiku Kusuo is a story about an average person with psychic abilities. It is still my favorite anime series of all time ever since watching it years ago. | ![alt text](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1973/142750.jpg) |
| 2 | Naruto: Shippuden | Naruto: Shippuden is a story about naruto and his journey to becoming a hokage and getting his friend back. It is a long series with 500 episodes but it is definitely worth it for the whole journey. It is my favorite shonen anime of all time. | ![alt text](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1565/111305.jpg) |
| 3 | Horimiya | Horimiya is by far my favorite romantic comedy anime for the simple fact that it is very wholesome with a good balance of romance, comedy, and drama. | ![alt text](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1695/111486.jpg) |
| 4 | That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime | Slime was a surprise favorite of mine. At first glance it may seem like a another generic isekai anime, however after watching it instantly became one of my favorites of all time. I honestly don't know what it is about it but I always have a good time watching it. | ![alt text](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1069/123309.jpg) |
| 5 | Bakuman | Bakuman is great story about two aspiring mangaka or manga artist trying to be successful. It provides great insight into the reality of manga artist while providing a great story as well. | ![alt text](https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/26138.jpg) |
